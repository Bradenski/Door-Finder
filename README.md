# Door Detection for Construction Drawings

A PyTorch-based computer vision system for detecting doors in architectural and construction drawings using YOLOv8 with domain adaptation.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a robust door detection system that bridges the domain gap between clean architectural drawings and noisy construction documents. The system achieves 72.8% mAP through systematic domain adaptation and intelligent preprocessing.

### Key Features
- **Multi-domain training**: 981 labeled images across architectural and construction domains
- **Transfer learning pipeline**: Hand-labeled 371 doors from sample_drawings.pdf enabling domain adaptation from clean architectural drawings (18% â†’ 69% recall)
- **Preprocessing proof of concept**: Connected component analysis for floor plan extraction from visually noisy construction documents 


## Results Summary

| Metric | Performance | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| mAP@0.5 | 72.8% | Strong generalization capability across diverse architectural drawing styles |
| Precision | 81.5% | Low false positive rate |
| Recall | 69.0% | Comprehensive door detection |
